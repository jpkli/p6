# P6: Declarative Specification for Designing Visual Analytics Processes

P6 is a research project for developing a declarative language for specifying visual analytics processes. P6 uses [P4](https://github.com/jpkli/p4) for parallel data processing and rendering, and leverages Python libraries for supporting machine learning algorithms.

## Installation
